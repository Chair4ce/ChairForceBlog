## Find The Real Problem

You might think this one is easy however, you've heard lots of people complain about many things, so it's easy to say 'of course
we have so many problems!'. I don't doubt you have tons of legitimate problems but can they really be solved with software? Is this
problem due to old technology or a lack of technology? Maybe the problem is a person, who knows?

If you want to start understanding what a problem really looks like in your organization. You have to turn this into a science.
Problems are not so obvious, and they are not on display 24/7 somewhere for anyone to solve. Just because there is some tool out there
that everyone thinks will solve the problem doesn't excuse your organization from doing the required research to validate
and prove that it can even be solved.

Start off by getting the most up-to-date snapshot of the current problem sets and make it a routine before every project.
Your first instinct may be to find the nearest SME to search for problems, surely they must know about all the problems, right?
You should avoid talking to SMEs exclusively. Talk to as many people as you can including new personnel. Sometimes fresh perspectives will highlight and validate
huge gaps in workflows that your SME may assume is 'working'.

Eventually this will help you build an affinity map of user problem spaces that connect workflow roles. Users have many problem spaces and some may overlap and then connect to other problem spaces.
This will important for your designers to be involved with. The designers on your team should take lead on this effort to synthesis all problem related data.
You may find problems that are very complex and may feel over whelming at first but the whole point of Agile is to start small. Find that one thing
you can solve right now, do it enough times, and eventually you will solve the entire space. Start thinking about how you can
measure these problems that arise during initial interviews. How can you tell that problems are real without going off of someone's word?

Interview every office in your AOR and start
mapping out problems and how far each web goes. You don't need to do a deep dive on each problem just yet, you just need
to identify patterns that surround a potential problem and how everyone perceives or may be affected by it. Once you compile
a good list of problems try to throw out those that are not validated by multiple
individuals. If only 1 out of 200 people complain about something chances are it's a people problem and not solvable with software.
If you find multiple perspectives of the same problem you might have an issue with a step in the process. The best kind of problems to solve
are the ones that affect the most amount of people with the lowest delta in perspective and align with a particular role.
In other words, don't weigh perspectives of individuals' performance over perspectives of their role. Some people may be doing everything right within
their role and the function that was created for that role is broken. The same can happen in reverse; the role is highly functional
but the performance is just not there. Not understanding this can lead to building useless software so make sure are working with real problems!

Ok so you've got 99 real problems, how do you decide on your first project? Find the easiest to solve that has the most impact on the unit
_right now_ and something your engineering team is confident in building quickly. This will set you up for your first win and will help gain traction
on building your teams inherent business value without having to sell it over and over again to leadership. Once you find a good
problem shoot for a build time of 30 days or less. This assumes you have a team ready to go so get that
part done first.

Take everything you learned after searching and interviewing for problems then rack and stack using whatever method you want to determine the
most feasible and impactful problem to solve. Take the top 3 problems and schedule your first meeting with your stakeholders,
so they can decide which problem spaces to conduct a deep dive.

Present your top 3 to 5 from the perspective of your stakeholder as if they are the hero's in this universe. What will they
gain for their users in their organization if this problem was already solved. Then give a brief synopsis on your teams
ability to deliver. You should leave that meeting with 1 or 2 problem spaces to prepare scoping sessions.

A Scoping is a deep dive with your team and reps from all parties affected by the problem. The goal is to determine the first set of features, what the product might look like in the first 3
months, the overall vision is for solving a particular problem space and last but not least, discuss any risks and mitigations.

You can break the ice in any scoping with these three questions:

- What problem are we solving and how is it manifested?
- How do you know this is a problem?
- Who raised this problem & at what level is this problem known?

You may already know the answers these at this point however, this will get the flow started and everyone relatively on the same page.

Fill the rest of the scoping with your favorite exercises to tease out key information. Use all that info to draft the first
couple features and how it will affect your users once delivered.

After we conducted several deep dives we built a [Mission Model Canvas](https://www.strategyzer.com/blog/posts/2016/2/24/the-mission-model-canvas-an-adapted-business-model-canvas-for-mission-driven-organizations 'MMC')
for each one.

Use whatever you want to display the results at the next stakeholder meeting and ask for a decision on building that product.

This is an important step to start building that routine in with your stakeholders. This allows them to communicate their buy-in and help determine a vision for the product.

Establish a series of Pivot or persevere meetings with your stakeholders. This will establish pivot points throughout your product life cycle
that gives the team and stakeholders the ability to continue with building the solution or pivot onto something more valuable.

If you want to be Agile don't get complacent. Before every Pivot or Persevere meeting you have with your stakeholders you
need to be prepared to execute a pivot, the decision won't always be to persevere. This brings me to another
factor that destroyed us. There were several pivot or persevere meetings where we should have pivoted instead of staying
on the same path. We broke some of the Agile principles that made us successful before developing our 5th app, and it hit us hard in the end. We were not prepared to pivot.
