## Find The Real Problem

You might think this one is easy however, you've heard lots of people complain about many things, so it's easy to say "of course
we have so many problems!". But are they real? I don't doubt you have tons of legitimate problems but can they be solved with software? Is this
problem due to an old technology or lack of technology? Maybe the problem is a person, who knows? Chances are you've got a mix of all of the above so determine which ones are
solvable, or your solutions might as well be a fart in the shower. You know, because it just lingers for a moment and then goes away.

Start off by getting the most up-to-date snapshot of your units current problem sets. Avoid only talking to SME's outside
your organization that did the job years ago, I am not saying you should ignore them however, they often describe old problems that do not accurately represent
the current climate. Interview every office in your department and start
mapping out problems and how far each web goes. You don't need to do a deep dive on each problem just yet, you just need
to identify patterns that surround a potential problem and how everyone perceives or may be affected by it. Once you compile
a good list of problems try to throw out those that are not validated by multiple
individuals. If only 1 out of 200 people complain about something chances are it's a people problem and not solvable with software.
If you find multiple perspectives of the same problem you might have an issue with a step in the process. The best kind of problems to solve
are the ones that affect the most amount of people with the lowest delta in perspective and align with a particular role.
In other words, don't weigh perspectives of individuals' performance over perspectives of their role. Some people may be doing everything right within
their role and the function that was created for that role is broken. The same can happen in reverse; the role is highly functional
but the performance is just not there. Not understanding this can lead to building useless software so make sure are working with real problems!

Ok so you've got 99 real problems, how do you decide on your first project? Find the easiest to solve that has the most impact on the unit
_right now_ and something your engineering team is confident in building quickly. This will set you up for your first win and will help gain traction
on building your teams inherent business value without having to sell it over and over again to leadership. Once you find a good
problem shoot for a build time of 30 days or less. This assumes you have a team ready to go so get that
part done first.

Take everything you learned after searching and interviewing for problems then rack and stack using whatever method you want to determine the
most feasible and impactful problem to solve. Take the top 3 problems and schedule your first meeting with your stakeholders,
so they can decide which problem space to conduct a deep dive.

Present your top 3 or 5 or whatever from the perspective of your stakeholder as if they are the hero's in this universe. What will they
gain for their users in their organization if this problem was already solved. Then give a brief synopsis on your teams
ability to deliver. You should leave that meeting with 1 or 2 problem spaces to prepare a Scoping session for.

A Problem Scoping is a deep dive with your team and reps from all parties affected by the problem. The goal is to determine the first set of features, what the product might look like in the first 3
months, the overall vision is for solving a particular problem space and last but not least, risks and mitigations.

You can break the ice in any scoping with these three questions:

- What problem are we solving and how is it manifested?
- How do you know this is a problem?
- Who raised this problem & at what level is this problem known?

You may already know the answers these at this point however, this will get the flow started and everyone relatively on the same page.

Fill the rest of the scoping with your favorite exercises to tease out key information. Use all that info to draft the first
couple features and how it will affect your users once delivered.

You should now have enough to build a [Mission Model Canvas](https://www.strategyzer.com/blog/posts/2016/2/24/the-mission-model-canvas-an-adapted-business-model-canvas-for-mission-driven-organizations 'MMC')

to pitch at the next stakeholder meeting to get a green light for building that product.
