## Origin of Red 5

Our origin story is a shining example of failing fast. I think we did it before it was cool, but if you are a part of an
outside organization, chances are you have already learned these lessons. However, if you are a small organic software
factory that builds software for active duty members, there might be a few lessons learned in here for you.

It all began with two very ambitious commanders. One of them went on to lead one of the biggest waves of software innovation
in the Air Force called Kessel Run, which you may have heard of. The other one gathered a small team of rebels and sent them
on a similar mission, however, it didn't go exactly as planned.

The contract for Pivotal Labs was approved, and their instructions were to teach us how to build and deliver Agile software.
A 4-member team was sent to Boston, and their full-time job was to sit alongside the "Pivots" and absorb everything they
could from them. They pitched a real solution to a real problem and used it as a pilot for a 6-month engagement. The plan
was to come back and install the app and the platform for the rest of the wing. Let's call this app App-Zero for context.
App-Zero was intended for a small set of users and then grow the app little by little, using proper Agile methods. Let's
call them the Zero-Users for now. This will become very important later on.

6 months later, the team returned as promised with fire in their hearts and a very small, freshly-minted full-stack web
application ready for the Zero-Users to use on mission and continue its development, or so they thought. They
did as much as they could within the 6-month engagement, but it still needed more work before it was ready for the big leagues.
I remember the day I received a call from the product owner, inviting me to join the software development team as a designer.
I had no formal training in software engineering or design, but I was immediately drawn to the team's vision for building
App-Zero and immediately accepted the offer.
Soon, I found myself surrounded by a team of highly-driven, dedicated individuals with a huge plan to carry on the development
of App-Zero, but something was wrong.

Turns out App-Zero and the platform that Pivotal promised to deliver hit a massive setback that basically stopped them from
doing what they were paid to do. While the team was out in Boston, work needed to be done at home to initiate the request
for an Authority to Operate (ATO) and create a landing pad for Pivotal's platform. Well, I think you can guess what happened.
The "landing pad" for App-Zero was definitely overpromised and underdelivered by, you guessed it, the "frozen middle." They
were not getting what they needed to bring this app home. Even after warnings were issued and flags were raised, not even the
commander could fix it in time before it was too late. The team was counting heavily on the few responsible for certain tasks,
including the ATO. They were so busy learning how to build software that there was no way they could do it on their own, and
when they returned, they felt defeated and perplexed that their support structure was gone.
Not me, though. I was so happy to be there, pairing for the first time as a brand-new software designer, getting a firehose of
information straight to the face. As a 3D1X2 Cyber Transport, I never thought in a million years I would
have this kind of opportunity fall in my lap. Anyway, that's not even the end of our failing fast adventure.

The Zero-Users were chosen as the first target because they were small and simple enough for the initial set of features on
the road map and even if App-Zero failed it would be of no consequence since the main point of the hiring Pivotal was
to establish a pipeline not just build an app. The Zero-Users happily agreed to help out, so they were off to their development phases.
During those 6 months they worked very hard to gain their trust and their
confidence to build them something they can actually use, until one day things changed for the worst.

One of the best things users can tell you while you are building software is "it works!" and "we love it!" These types of
comments drove the team forward and validated the small, iterative features they delivered week after week. However, 5 months
into the engagement, the assumption that users loved the app backfired immediately when the team found out, well after it was
ready for mission, that they weren't even using it. How does this happen? The team delivered each feature with 5 out of 5
raving reviews, only to find out that they hadn't even started using it. A giant exclamation point just appeared over the
head of every team member, including the "Pivots." "What do you mean you are not using it?" the team asked. "It's not
approved software," a supervisor responded. The team tried to explain how different this situation was, how its development
was initiated by the wing commander, and how the whole point of building the software with them for the past five months
was understood by all parties involved that it would be ready for production and used on mission. Ultimately, the Airmen
were ordered not to use it because it was not a "program of record." Before all you security folks scream, "Well, they're
right, why are they not using approved software?!" The team understood, and the wing commander accepted this risk. They knew
they were rebels in this environment and were out to prove the Agile model, with full intention of getting an ATO, but they
needed to prove that Agile worked first.
Anyway, the product team had to pivot and figure out how to get them to start using the app. They thought, "This is an easy
fix; we just ask the wing commander to send out a letter to "approve" the app." Little did the team know, yet another disaster
would ensue.

## The letter that destroyed everything?

The wing commander agreed that the solution was to send a letter to the site. That was a no-brainer for obvious reasons.
The letter was prepped and proclaimed that App-Zero was ready to start using on mission, with a giant stamp of approval
from the wing commander. Well, this turned out to be the same kind of letter that Inspector Gadget received before it would
self-destruct. Though instead of blowing up in the hands of its intended recipient, it would blow up the development team
instead. How could a single letter destroy everything?

The users our team was working with were a very small part of the entire organization. Eventually, the app would be built
to scale and tailored to the rest of the sites like any other enterprise-level software, but they had to keep it hidden
from the rest of the sites. Building software immediately to scale is not Agile, especially with an 8-person team (plus 4 "Pivots").
They had to prove its value in small increments, starting with the smallest scope feasible.

So they sent the letter out, but instead of sending it to the site, it was accidentally sent to the entire wing. Every
squadron and every group, including guard sites, received this email from the wing commander with instructions to start
using App-Zero right now. The email with the approval letter included instructions to log in and start using it on
mission - the Zero-Users mission. If there was ever a heart-stopping moment in the history of this team, this was it.
Soon, the team had to go into damage control. Every unit, with completely different mission sets, jumped on App-Zero
to see what this was all about and then immediately called the wing yelling "WHISKEY TANGO FOXTROT?" Like an orchestra,
they all shouted "We can't use this!" and "Why is the wing commander making us use broken software?!" Well, you would
think that there would be an easy explanation that would fix this right? It was simply not ready to scale to the entire
enterprise. Unfortunately, it was not that simple; the damage was done and no other users, even the "Zero-Users," wanted
to work with the team anymore. Any effort to recover App-Zero was too great.

Soon, rumors spread, and the original vision and perception of this whole engagement with the team and App-Zero was
destroyed in a single email. This new perception of the team trying to deliver "broken software" to everyone solidified
an old habit - we must wait for software to be completely finished before anyone even touches it. Then, 2 out of the 4
original team members were recalled to their original units, and suddenly almost half of our team was gone. But not all
hope was lost; we were not ready to give up.

## Red 5 was born

We never really thought of a team name, so we just called ourselves the Software Development Team (SDT) - sometimes
confused for STD. It was an experience unlike any other - the energy was electric, and we didn't let the past affect us.
We pushed forward with everything we had. We decided to pitch an idea to one of the co-located groups on base to start
over. We essentially adopted new leadership that also believed in us as much as our outgoing wing commander. It felt like
we had a new shield protecting us from anything that tried to stand in our way.

Our new leadership provided top cover and then left us to our own devices, which allowed us to be autonomous and free to
succeed (or fail). But with this kind of freedom came enormous responsibility, and we knew that in order to succeed, we
had to give ourselves permission to fail. It was a scary, yet exhilarating feeling - the confidence that we would succeed
mixed with the fear that we might fail again. But we didn't let that fear hold us back. We charged towards our failures
with determination and resilience, learning from our mistakes and moving forward.

After some convincing, we acquired some new computers and some space to start working. We became a new team unlike any
other within our group, and soon it seemed that everyone wanted a piece of what we had - the freedom to innovate. Our
previous dead-ends were just a notch on the board, a reminder of what didn't work, and a motivation to keep pressing
forward. It was an incredible feeling to not be afraid of the word "no." It was a truly magical experience, and one
that I will always remember.

We were determined to find problems that our new agile methods could solve, so we conducted extensive user research and
interviewed as many people as possible from various offices and positions. As we spoke with more people, patterns began
to emerge, and we found close to 50 unique problem areas. The more we learned about these problems, the more complex they seemed.

We used the information we gathered to prove the existence of these issues and presented them to leadership in a meeting
called Problem Discovery. We were surprised to find that some problems thought to have been solved by leadership were
actually worse than before. In other cases, the issues were so small that it was astonishing that no one had attempted
to solve them using available tools.

Manual research like this is underused in the military. Industry can do it well, but we don't give them access to users.
We often rely on large surveys or broadcast emails for feedback, but these methods often have low response rates. Instead
of truly understanding the problems facing our airmen, we end up implementing our own ideas without proper input. Even
the best ideas often float up from the source as so-called SMEs inject their 20-year-old input, and by the time it makes
its way onto a desk that can actually secure funds, it has lost its ability to solve the problem.

Our success in user research was due in part to our genuine care for the users and our ability to establish trust with
them. As a result, they were more honest about their problems and felt comfortable sharing ideas that they might have
otherwise been hesitant to bring up to leadership.

We locked in on one of the problem spaces we found with the highest impact and value. We really needed a quick win to
re-establish our original vision before the team went out to Boston. It turned out to be a winner. We built our first
successful app, used by thousands and still living on today. It's called The Black Pearl.

It wasn't until much later, around App Four, that we finalized the team name Red 5, but this is definitely the story
that inspired it. From the ashes, we rose up like rebels (Agile) to fight the evil empire (Frozen Middle) to destroy
the Death Star (Waterfall).

## After testing out many logos...

### Started with this one for a while:
